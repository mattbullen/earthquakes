## Predict Earthquake Magnitudes using Azure Machine Learning

My final project for Harvard's CSCI E-63 course, Big Data Analytics. The server side uses Microsoft's Azure machine learning platform. The UI uses D3.js.

The app predicts hypothetical earthquake magnitudes using a machine learning model hosted on Azure ML. Training data is obtained from a 30-day rolling U.S. Geological Survey data feed.
